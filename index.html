    <h3>Dig Safe, Protect Yourself and Your Family</h3>
    <p>JULIE, Inc. (Joint Utility Locating Information for Excavators) is a not-for-profit corporation that provides homeowners and professional excavators with only one place to contact for safer digging</p>
    <p>State law requires that actual person doing the digging to contact JULIE with locate request information at least 48 hours (two business days, excludes weekends and holidays) in advance of the start of excavation. You will be provided with a "dig number" for your records. 
      You must begin your project within 14 calendar days from the time you contact JULIE. If you want to start your project over the weekend, remember to contact JULIE by Wednesday at 4 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>Even if you're digging in the same location as a previous project, contact JULIE. Digging juat a little to left or right or a little deeper can damage an underground utility line. It's happened to other homeowners, don'tlet it happen to you.</p>
    <p>Our member utilities are only required to mark the lines that they own, not privately installed or owned lines. Privately owned lines may include water and sewer services as well as electric and gas lines to a garage or workshop.</p>
    <p>In order to help the memeber utility locator properly identify your project area, JULIE recommends that you pre-mark the area where you will be digging with white paint and/or flags.</p>
